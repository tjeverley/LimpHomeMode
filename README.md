# LimpHomeMode
Game/project files for Limp Home Mode, a top-down resource management sim on a dying 
spaceship.

**Install**
To run the game, download the files in this folder. Once downloaded, run the file titled 
"Limp Home Mode.exe" to start the game.

**Future updates**
1. Crafting system:
   There are plans for the crafting system to be updated to check the player inventory
   for resources before room items can be built.
2. Quest handler:
   Certain quests, which are due to spawn after the completion of a previous quest, are
   not loading as expected. These will be looked at and corrected.
3. Crew stations:
   In an upcoming update, players will be able to assign the rescued crewman to one of 3
   stations on the ship. Each station will provide boost to the station-relevant system.
4. Station access:
   In an upcoming update, door to different parts of the ship will become locked off to
   the player. Unlocking doors will be controlled via a rewiring mini-game located in
   the bridge. Players will eventually be able to craft breakout boards at the workbench
   to allow the rewiring of multiple doors at once.
